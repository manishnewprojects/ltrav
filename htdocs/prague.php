 Prague is one of the most beautiful and very tourist friendly city I have been to. The whole city is also very walkable and at the same time like Jeep Cherokee nation is a part of you, but they did not adopt euro as their currency. The Czech corona is a, their own currency and when I visited it was about $1 to 20 kroner. So, uh, made spending the day on a, on a budget fight, easy start out. You're exploring by going to the Charles River, very centrally located historic bridge on the river. The bridge itself is a quite fascinating and I'm friendly. Uh, I would advise you to get there early in the morning if possible when the tourists are not there. So you can enjoy the beauty of a structure itself along with the views of the river and the buildings along the river. On the bridge itself, you will find many interesting statues and plaques. Each of those have a somewhat of an interesting history. 

You can certainly google and read about those. One of my favorites is of the night with a dog. They actually have it engraved. I think societies that treat their animals well generally reflect a good human nature. There's also a plaque with an interesting tale of a monk who was thrown over the bridge into the river and eventually came back as a martyr from the bridge itself. A very interesting area to work is to the Jewish or account. It's about a 10 minute walk from the bridge. As you're walking away from the bridge, the hill on your left and up. Then you will see an interesting site like gigantic maternal, which is a recent relatively recent addition, uh, at one time in the past at this location up on the hill that was sort of gigantic money rent, no Stalin and the Soviet Union by the Czech people. That monument has a very interesting history, which you can see in detail at the Museum of Communism, which we'll talk about it a little bit later. What color to the Jewish district? Uh, you can google maps a Jewish cemetery or a synagogue and you will find the directions to walk over there. A lot of interesting sites, um, in spite of the Nazi atrocities, the Jewish population in Prague, uh, not only to survive or is now thriving, uh, the historic synagogue and submit to the yard are beautiful to look at. And uh, I, I thought there was a clock on top of a building with Hebrew letters. I thought that was kinda interesting. 

I was not really impressed with the food choices in an hour. The Charles Bridge area seemed kind of touristy and expensive. And my notice says in big, bold letters, painting food that right there for me, he's a big question mark. So pick up a Bagel or two from one of the bakeries and Dr. be a good start for the day.
